[35mThe object of the game is
to be the first to collect %d points by rolling dice.

[36mIf it is your turn you roll the dice to accumulate points.
If you roll a 7, you lose your points for that turn.
If you roll anything else, you accumulate those points.
You may stay at any time while rolling the dice.  If you
choose to stay, you will keep the points you have earned.
Everyone else will get a chance to roll before the dice
are returned to you.  If you reach %d points first, you
win the game!
