 WHAT IS PIG?

 Pig! is a multi-player dice roll game (that can be played against Mr. Pig,
 the computer player).  The object of the game is simple: to be the first to 
 collect the requisite number of points (set by SysOp) by rolling dice.
 
 GAMEPLAY
 
 When it is your turn, you roll the dice to accumulate points.  However, if 
 you roll a 7, you immediately lose your turn, and the points that you've 
 accumulated.  If you roll anything else, you accumulate those points.
 
 You may stay at any time while rolling the dice.  If you choose to stay, 
 you will keep the points you have earned - staying "banks" the points,
 so that should you roll a 7 your next turn, you still have the points
 that you had when you stayed.  When you stay, everyone else will get a 
 chance to roll before the dice are returned to you.  
 
 If you reach the set point total first, you win the game!
